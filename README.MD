## Breaking News

Just added a [Sponsor this project](https://ko-fi.com/ch4mpy) link to the repo ;-)

The OAuth2 BFF tutorial is now [on Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-cloud-gateway-bff-oauth2). It was deeply refreshed in the process and now contains samples for Angular, React (Next.js) and Vue (Vite).

In `7.6.0`, the experimental support for `RestClient` and `WebClient` builders as well as `@HttpExchange` (the successor of `@FeignClient`) is moved to a dedicated starter: [`spring-addons-starter-rest`](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-starter-rest). As a reminder, it helps to get pre-configured client builders and `@HttpExchange` proxies with this clients

`7.5.0` comes with an important refactoring of the way JWT decoder(s) configuration is resolved. This greatly eases ["dynamic" multi-tenant scenarios implementation](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-starter-oidc#1-1-4). The only noticeable breaking change is the removal of `SpringAddonsOidcProperties::getOpProperties`. This feature is now the responsibility of the newly introduced `OpenidProviderPropertiesResolver`. The default implementation resolves properties with an exact match on issuer (just as `getOpProperties` was doing). As usual, auto-configured bean backs-off if you expose one to use another properties resolving strategy.

**Important warning for those using `@WithJwt` (and since `7.3.0`, `@WithMockJwtAuth`) but not `spring-addons-starter-oidc`**: you should expose your JWT converter as a bean. See [`spring-addons-oauth2-test` README](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-oauth2-test) for details.

## [OIDC starter](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-starter-oidc)

With `spring-addons-starter-oidc`, you might need 0 Java conf, even in scenarios like:
- accepting tokens issued by several trussted authorization servers
- mapping authorities from a variety of claims
- needing custom OAuth2 redirection URI or HTTP status
- having per environment CORS configuration (not allowing the same origins in staging and prod for instance)
- exposing CSRF token as a cookie accessible to a single-page application
- logging out from an authorization server not strictly implementing RP-Initiated Logout (case of Auth0 and Amazon Cognito for instance)
- adding extra parameters to authorization or token requests (like the `audience` required by Auth0)

## Unit & Integration Testing With Security

Testing access control requires to configure the test security context.  For that, `spring-security-test` provides with `MockMvc` request post-processors and `WebTestClient` mutators, but this can work only in the context of a request, which limits its usage to controllers.

To test any type of `@Component` (`@Controller`, off course, but also `@Service` and `@Repository`) there are  only two options:
- build tests security context by yourself and populate it with stubbed / mocked authentications
- use annotations to do it for you (this is where [spring-addons-oauth2-test](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-oauth2-test) jumps in)

Useful resources:
- [spring-addons-oauth2-test](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-oauth2-test) contains tests annotations and its README documents usage
- [spring-addons-starter-oidc-test](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-starter-oidc-test) if you use `spring-addons-starter-oidc`
- [Baeldung article](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-oauth-testing-access-control)
- [samples](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/samples) and [tutorials](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/samples/tutorials) source-code (which contain a lot of unit and integration testing)

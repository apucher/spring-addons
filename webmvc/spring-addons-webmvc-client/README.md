# `spring-addons-webmvc-client`
A thin wrapper around `spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client` which pushes auto-configuration one step further.

## How it works
As any boot starter, a resource file defines what should be loaded: [`src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports`](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/blob/master/webmvc/spring-addons-webmvc-client/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports) which specifies that two configuration sources should be loaded:
- [`SpringAddonsOAuth2ClientBeans`](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/blob/master/webmvc/spring-addons-webmvc-client/src/main/java/com/c4_soft/springaddons/security/oauth2/config/synchronised/SpringAddonsOAuth2ClientBeans.java) with a bunch of OAuth2 client related beans configurable from application properties
- [`SpringAddonsBackChannelLogoutBeans`](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/blob/master/webmvc/spring-addons-webmvc-client/src/main/java/com/c4_soft/springaddons/security/oauth2/config/synchronised/SpringAddonsBackChannelLogoutBeans.java) which contains the beans definition for a client [Back-Channel Logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html) implementation: a security filter-chain and a `@RestController`.

Also, as any serious Boot starter, any bean defined there is conditional, so that one way or another, you can deactivate or overload it.

## What is auto configured
The most accurate information about [`SpringAddonsOAuth2ClientBeans`](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/blob/master/webmvc/spring-addons-webmvc-client/src/main/java/com/c4_soft/springaddons/security/oauth2/config/synchronised/SpringAddonsOAuth2ClientBeans.java) and [`SpringAddonsBackChannelLogoutBeans`](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/blob/master/webmvc/spring-addons-webmvc-client/src/main/java/com/c4_soft/springaddons/security/oauth2/config/synchronised/SpringAddonsBackChannelLogoutBeans.java) is in the source and Javadoc, but here is an idea of the auto configured beans.

### SpringAddonsOAuth2ClientBeans
- `springAddonsClientFilterChain`: a security filter-chain instantiated only if `com.c4-soft.springaddons.security.client.security-matchers` property has at least one entry. If defined, it is a high precedence, to ensure that all routes defined in this security matcher property are intercepted by this filter-chain. Refer to [`SpringAddonsOAuth2ClientProperties`](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/blob/master/spring-addons-oauth2/src/main/java/com/c4_soft/springaddons/security/oauth2/config/SpringAddonsOAuth2ClientProperties.java) for configuration options. **If you provide a `login-path` in the application properties, you'll also have to provide with a controller to handle that path**. There can be two motivation for that: you want to write your own login page or you want to enable SSL when bound to port `80` or `8080`.
- `oAuth2AuthorizationRequestResolver`: default instance is a `SpringAddonsOAuth2AuthorizationRequestResolver` which sets the client hostname in the redirect URI with `com.c4-soft.springaddons.security.client.client-uri`. It is configured as the authorization request resolver to use only if a `login-path` was provided (this resolver was designed to work around PortMapperImpl aggressively modifying 80 and 8080 ports in all login redirect URIs when SSL is enabled and works in together with an absolute URI for the login page).
- `logoutRequestUriBuilder`: builder for [RP-Initiated Logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0.html) queries, taking configuration from properties for OIDC providers which do not strictly comply with the spec: logout URI not provided by OIDC conf or non standard parameter names (Auth0 and Cognito are samples of such OPs)
- `logoutSuccessHandler`: default instance is a `SpringAddonsOAuth2LogoutSuccessHandler` which logs a user out from the last authorization server he logged on
- `authoritiesConverter`: an `OAuth2AuthoritiesConverter`. Default instance is a `ConfigurableClaimSet2AuthoritiesConverter` which reads spring-addons `SpringAddonsSecurityProperties`
- `grantedAuthoritiesMapper`: a `GrantedAuthoritiesMapper` using the already configured `OAuth2AuthoritiesConverter`
- `corsConfigurationSource`: CORS configuration built from `SpringAddonsOAuth2ClientProperties`
- `oAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository`: a `SpringAddonsOAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository` (which is also a session listener) capable of handling multi-tenancy and [Back-Channel Logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html)
- `clientAuthorizePostProcessor`: a post processor to fine tune access control from java configuration. It applies to all routes not listed in "permit-all" property configuration. Default requires users to be authenticated. **This is a bean to provide in your application configuration if you prefer to define fine-grained access control rules with Java configuration rather than methods security.**
- `clientHttpPostProcessor`: a post processor to override anything from above auto-configuration. It is called just before the security filter-chain is returned. Default is a no-op.

### SpringAddonsBackChannelLogoutBeans
This two beans are instantiated only if `com.c4-soft.springaddons.security.client.back-channel-logout-enabled` is `true`
- `springAddonsBackChannelLogoutClientFilterChain`: a filter chain with highest precedence intercepting requests to just `/backchannel_logout`, with no session, no CSRF protection and no access-control: security is based on ly on the logout JWT in the request payload.
- `BackChannelLogoutController` a REST controller to handle just the POST requests to `/backchannel_logout` with a logout JWT provided as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

## Sample usage
The [resource server & UI](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/samples/tutorials/resource-server_with_ui) tutorial uses this starter to configure a Spring Boot application with a client security filter-chain (in addition to a resource server one configured with `spring-addons-webmvc-jwt-resource-server` starter). In this sample, the Java web-security configuration is reduced to almost nothing, all the configuration being defined with the following properties:
```yaml
